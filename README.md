I would prefer to request data from the server using Angular's built-in HTTP client service, which allows for asynchronous requests to be made to the server and handles the response using Observables.
<br/>
You can pass additional data to the server by including it as a query parameter in the HTTP request URL, or by adding it to the request headers using the HttpHeaders class.
<br/>
You can organize data exchange between components by creating a shared service that can be injected into each component that needs to interact with the data.
<br/>
You can display an unlimited nesting data tree in a Component template using Angular's built-in recursive templates or by using a third-party library like PrimeNG or NGX-Treeview.

I prefer to use reactive forms because they provide a more flexible and scalable way of managing form data in Angular applications, and also allow for easier validation and handling of user input.

When using an iframe with a dynamic URL, it is important to ensure that the URL is sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Angular provides a built-in DomSanitizer service that can be used to sanitize URLs before they are rendered in the iframe.
